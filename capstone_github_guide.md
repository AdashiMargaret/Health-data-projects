### Key Messages for Different Roles

**For Public Health Analyst Positions:**
> "This research demonstrates my ability to conduct rigorous epidemiological analysis on population health data, identify actionable risk factors, and translate findings into evidence-based public health recommendations. The 73% mortality reduction associated with optimal birth spacing provides clear intervention targets."

**For Global Health Roles:**
> "My analysis of Nigerian demographic data showcases skills directly applicable to international development work: large-scale survey analysis, understanding of resource-limited settings, and ability to generate policy-relevant findings for maternal-child health programming."

**For Healthcare Data Science Roles:**
> "This project highlights advanced statistical modeling capabilities, experience with real-world healthcare data, and ability to handle complex datasets while maintaining rigorous quality standards. The comprehensive model validation demonstrates technical depth."

**For Clinical Research Positions:**
> "The systematic approach to confounding control, effect modification testing, and model diagnostics reflects understanding of clinical research standards. The focus on modifiable risk factors demonstrates translation from analysis to intervention development."

**For Policy & Advocacy Roles:**
> "My research directly addresses health equity by quantifying the 67% mortality disparity between richest and poorest families. This demonstrates ability to use data for social justice advocacy and evidence-based policy development."

### Elevator Pitch Framework

**30-Second Version:**
"I conducted a comprehensive epidemiological analysis of infant mortality in Northern Nigeria using nationally representative data from 80,000 women. My research identified six key risk factors and found that wealth inequality and birth spacing are the strongest predictors, with the richest families showing 67% lower infant mortality. This work demonstrates my ability to translate complex health data into actionable public health recommendations."

**60-Second Version:**
"My capstone research analyzed infant mortality patterns in Northern Nigeria using advanced statistical methods on a dataset of 80,110 women. Through multivariable logistic regression, I identified that socioeconomic factors—particularly wealth and maternal education—are the strongest predictors of infant survival, with effect sizes ranging from 14% to 73% risk reduction. The research follows rigorous epidemiological standards with comprehensive model validation and directly supports evidence-based interventions. This project showcases my expertise in population health analysis, statistical modeling, and translating research into policy recommendations—skills I'm excited to apply in [specific role/organization]."
